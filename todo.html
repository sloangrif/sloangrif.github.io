          <p class="item-about">As a part of my internship at Grooveshark, I was given the task of designing an agenda or task application, which I named the “ToDo App”. I began by documenting everything that needed to be included within the application. Components such as the types of pages, functionality, and what I would allow the user to customize were listed. My research included study and assessment of the features and functionality of existing products offered in the App Store. Once I was able to determine the most important elements to be included in the application, I began to sketch out designs and eventually create the app on Photoshop. There were several different iterations in the design, but the final product is shown here. I have displayed the three main pages of the app, which includes the Landing Page, Detail Page, as well as a view of the apps functionality.
