            <p>Apart of the ending of my internship at Grooveshark, I was given the task of designing a ToDo App. I began by documenting everything that needed to be include inside of the page. This include the types of pages, functionality, and what I would allow the user to customize. This process include research of multiple other ToDo Apps inside of the App store. Once I was able to determine the most important elements to be included in the app, I began to sketch out designs and eventually create the app on Photoshop. There were a few different interations but the final product is shown here. I have included the three main pages of the app here. This includes the Landing Page, Detail Page, as well as what it looks like to use some of the apps functionality.</p>

              <p>I began working with a group of students who aspired to create a website that servered as a social media platform for STEM majors. Instead of using things like Facebook or Twitter, they wanted there to be a place where STEM related topics could be discussed without the distractions with come with other social media websites. I was called upon to create their company logo, which also included designing marketing merchandise. I created a mobile app icon, the logo for the website itself, as well as tshirt, computer sticker and flyers.</p>

              <p>As apart of my internship at Grooveshark, I want a variety of icons for web. These icons were made using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I created these icons as a learning experience about how to create icons using Adobe programs and the size icons should be based on the screen they are viewed on.</p>
