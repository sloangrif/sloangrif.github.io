            <p>I designed for a local startup company here in Gainesville named, Mapn&trade;. These are mockups I made for the three main pages of the web app. Mapn&trade; is a video broadcasting app focsued on small towns and buisness's. The designs shown here include, the main map page which acts as the center of functionality for the app, a buisness pin page, as well as a buisness analytics page. While designing, I strived to keep the design as simple as possible, while still maintaining an interactive experience for the user.</p>

            <p>As a part of my internship at Grooveshark, I was given the task of designing an agenda or task application, which I named the “ToDo App”. I began by documenting everything that needed to be included within the application. Components such as the types of pages, functionality, and what I would allow the user to customize were listed. My research included study and assessment of the features and functionality of existing products offered in the App Store. Once I was able to determine the most important elements to be included in the application, I began to sketch out designs and eventually create the app on Photoshop. There were several different iterations in the design, but the final product is shown here. I have displayed the three main pages of the app, which includes the Landing Page, Detail Page, as well as a view of the apps functionality.</p>

              <p>I began working with a group of students who aspired to create a website that served as a social media platform for STEM majors. Instead of using things like Facebook or Twitter, they wanted a place where STEM related topics could be discussed without the distractions that come with other social media websites. I was called upon to create their company logo, which also included designing marketing merchandise. I created a mobile app icon, the logo for the website itself, as well as tee shirt, computer sticker and flyers.</p>
