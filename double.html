          <p class="item-about">This is a double exposure piece I have created. The two images consist of the image of the young girl and the image of a burning building exposed in her eyes. My goal with this piece was too create the story that this young girl was watching something tragic happen to the building her family lived in. To create this mood, I desaturated the image of the girl and put the image of the building in the area of her eyes. I added tints of red to different areas of the image of the young girl. I lightened the area of her face to emphasize that darkness of everything else around her.</p>
