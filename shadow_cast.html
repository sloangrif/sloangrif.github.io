          <p class="item">Shadow Cast</p>
          <p class="item-about">Shadow Cast is a 2D side scroll game that was developed by myself and three other team members. The team name we created for ourselves was Sunshine Daisy Studios. I was the aesthetic lead so I created all of the environments and was involved in the design of the main characters. I also designed the aesthetic of the UI elements of the game, including the main menu, how to play, game and team logos as well as the credits. I designed the aesthetic of the cut scenes and made them into videos using final cut pro. I was also heavily involved the in the creation of our story. I also implement the Shadow Health, Shadow AI, Main character health scripts. I also implement death and falling triggers and scripts.
            <br></br>I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create the environments. When I went to create the look of each 2D environment, I wanted to keep a three dimensional look. I created three levels of ground with three varying levels of color saturation. The idea was to stay very monochromatic to emphasize the theme of the game.
            <br></br>Below is an introduction to our game:
            <br></br><i>Sunshine Daisy Studios presents Shadow Cast, a game filled with dread and urgency as you race to protect the people you love from menacing Shadows.  Playing as a Viking warrior women who foresees an attack on her village and Chieftain, our story follows her mission to save them from the Shadows. Through many obstacles and battles against the Shadows, she gradually makes way home, but is home better off without her?
