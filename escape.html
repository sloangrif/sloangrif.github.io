          <p class="item">The Escape</p>
          <p class="item-about">The story of bouncy balls who are ready to escape the life of toys and venture off on their own. This short film was all modeled and animated by myself. My assignment was to animate two spheres, so I decided I wanted to create a story behind why these spheres were being animated. The idea was that there is a box full of toy boucy balls and they notice the window is left open. One ball decides it is his chance to escape the captivity of the toy box. After he makes his escape, other bouncy balls follow.</p>
